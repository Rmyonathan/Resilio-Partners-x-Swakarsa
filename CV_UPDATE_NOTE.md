# CV Files Update Required

## ✅ ATS-Compliant Resumes Created

**NEW:** ATS-compliant resume templates have been created for all marketing team members following US standards. These are located in `public/cv/ATS_RESUMES/`:

- AHMAD_MUSYAARI_RASYID_ATS.txt
- GREGORIO_YANSEN_ATS.txt
- ASEP_SAEFUDDIN_ATS.txt
- TAUFIQ_HIDAYAT_ATS.txt
- REYNARDI_GUNAWAN_ATS.txt
- RICHIE_ARDIANTO_ATS.txt

### Converting to PDF:
1. Open the `.txt` file in Microsoft Word or Google Docs
2. Apply minimal formatting (standard fonts, simple layout, no graphics)
3. Save as PDF
4. Test with ATS checker tools (Jobscan.co, Resume.io, VMock)

## Action Required for Team Members

All CV PDF files in the `public/cv/` folder need to be updated to comply with US/Western standards for professional CVs. Use the ATS-compliant templates as a reference.

### Required Changes:

1. **Remove Photos** - Remove all photos from CVs. US CV standards do not include photos.

2. **Remove Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**:
   - Home addresses (location/country only)
   - Personal phone numbers (email contact only)
   - Any other sensitive personal information

3. **Keep Only Professional Information**:
   - Name
   - Professional title/role
   - Email address (professional)
   - LinkedIn profile (optional)
   - Professional experience
   - Skills and qualifications

4. **ATS Compliance Formatting**:
   - Simple, clean layout (no tables, graphics, or complex formatting)
   - Standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
   - Black text on white background
   - Standard section headers (PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY, EXPERIENCE, EDUCATION, etc.)
   - Chronological format with clear date ranges

### Current CV Files in `public/cv/`:
- CV AHMAD MUSYAARI RASYID 2025.pdf
- CV M.TAUFIQ HIDAYAT.pdf
- CV Reynardi Gunawan.pdf
- CV Yansen.pdf
- Richie Ardianto CV.pdf
- cv asep.pdf

### Note:
The website already displays team members with initials instead of photos on the team page. The CV PDFs themselves need manual updates by each team member to remove photos and PII for security and compliance with US standards. Use the ATS-compliant templates in `public/cv/ATS_RESUMES/` as a guide.
